[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/fastcomments-react-native-sdk.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastcomments-react-native-sdk)

## Installation

```sh
npm install fastcomments-react-native-sdk --save
```

## About

This library is a complete react-native implementation of [FastComments](https://fastcomments.com).

It supports live commenting, chat, threads, emoticons, notifications, SSO, skins, and full customization by passing in a stylesheet object. All assets
can also be customized, and it supports toggling different assets based on dark mode.

It all runs on the FastComments backend, so you only have to incorporate the UI:

```tsx
    <FastCommentsLiveCommenting config={config} styles={styles} callbacks={callbacks} assets={assets}/>
```

See [example/src](./example/src) for more examples.

Add live chat to your existing React Native application, or even build a social network!

### Rich Text Editor

This library uses the 10tap editor for rich text editing functionality, which provides a powerful WYSIWYG editing experience.

### Configuration Options

This library aims to support all configuration options defined in [fastcomments-typescript](https://github.com/FastComments/fastcomments-typescript/blob/main/src/fast-comments-comment-widget-config.ts), just like the web implementation.

### FastComments Concepts

The main concepts to be aware of to get started are `tenantId` and `urlId`. `tenantId` is your FastComments.com account identifier. `urlId` is where comment threads
will be tied to. This could be a page URL, or a product id, an article id, etc.

### User Notifications

FastComments supports notifications for [many scenarios](https://docs.fastcomments.com/guide-notifications.html). Notifications are configurable,
can be opted-out globally or at a notification/comment level, and supports page-level subscriptions so that users can subscribe to threads of a
specific page or article.

For example, it is possible to use Secure SSO to authenticate the user and then periodically poll for unread notifications and push them to the user.

See [the example AppNotificationSecureSSO](./example/src/AppNotificationsSecureSSO.tsx) for how to get and translate unread user notifications.

### Gif Browser

By default, no image or gif selection is enabled. See [example/src/AppCommentingImageSelection.tsx](./example/src/AppCommentingImageSelection.tsx) for how
to support image and gif uploads. There is a Gif Browser that anonymizes searches and images provided in this library, you simply have to use it.

### Performance

Please open a ticket with an example to reproduce, including device used, if you identify any performance problems. Performance is a first-class citizen
of all FastComments libraries.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please open a GitHub issue first and tag `@winrid` to confirm it is not something we are already working on (or not able to accept).
Keep in mind that most features should be opt-in by default to maximize flexibility and performance.
